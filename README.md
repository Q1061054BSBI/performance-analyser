# Educational Project: Web Application Performance Analysis

## Project Description

This project was created for educational purposes to develop and test a system for analyzing the performance of web applications. The primary focus is on data processing and analysis using modern technologies and machine learning models.

## Project Goals
- Explore data analysis capabilities using correlation models, time series analysis, and anomaly detection methods.
- Optimize the volume of collected data without compromising analysis accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis:** Python, libraries such as Scikit-learn, PyTorch

## Usage
1. Ensure data has been collected and preprocessed.
2. Use scripts from `/data-analysis` to analyze the collected data and test models.

## Limitations
- This project is intended for educational purposes only.
- The system is not designed for production use without further development.
